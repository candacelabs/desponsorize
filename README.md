# Desponsorize

Chrome extension to suppress "Sponsored" results on Amazon.com

## Motivation

Big tech's dark pattern of making sponsored results look just like ACTUAL search results make all of our lives unilaterally worse. This just undoes that.

## Download

## Install From Source Yourself

Alternatively, if you don't feel like giving me money (BOOOOOO), you can clone this and install this from source into Chrome yourself
